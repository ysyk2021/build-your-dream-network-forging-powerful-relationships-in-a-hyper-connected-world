Your personal brand is the sum of your professional reputation, online presence, and the way people perceive you. It encompasses your expertise, values, and unique qualities that set you apart from others. To build credibility and authority, start by understanding and defining your personal brand:

* **Self-Reflection**: Take time to reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, and values. What do you want to be known for? What are your passions and expertise?

* **Audience Perception**: Seek feedback from colleagues, mentors, and friends to gain insights into how others perceive you. What do people say about you when you're not in the room?

* **Consistency**: Ensure that your online and offline personas align. Consistency in your actions, messaging, and image helps build trust.

Establishing Your Online Presence
